# Car Tracker

- A web app project built with Next.js frontend and a Go server that allows users to track cars that they have owned and that they want to own in the future

## Using the App

- The frontend is deployed live at URL.
- The server and database must be run locally. This was done to avoid privacy issues and reduce cost of hosting.
- To set up the server please see the README in the server directory
